IS117 Assignment 3
Part1:
Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

Create a "**repository**" (project) with a **git** hosting tool (like **GitHub**)
Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
Add a file to your local repo and "**commit**" (save) the changes
"**Push**" your changes to your main branch
Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
"**Pull**" the changes to your local machine
Create a "**branch**" (version), make a change, commit the change
Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
"**Merge**" your branch to the main branch...sometimes a merge conflict may arise when saving due to discrepencies
Git is program that can be used in your IDE such as Webstorm or VS Code...personally I prefer to use VS Code because it is simpler.
GitHub is basically a hub for your projects involving web development that you work on using git.
